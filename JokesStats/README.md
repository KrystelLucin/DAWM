<h1>API JOKES STATS</h1>
<p>In this project, <a href="https://rapidapi.com/Sv443/api/jokeapi-v2/">JokeAPI v2</a> is used to obtain statistics of the characteristics of the jokes. To do this, 50 requests are made to the API so that each time it returns a random joke with an id from 0 to 150.</p>
<p>First, the data for</p>
<ul>
    <li>Jokes</li>
    <li>Categories</li>
    <li>Flags</li>
    <li>Types</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have 4 different graphs</p>
<ul>
    <li>A line graph showing the number of vowels used in jokes.</li>
    <li>A bar graph where you can filter if you want to see the amount of jokes by categories, flags or types.</li>
    <li>A donut graph to show how many of the jokes obtained from the requests are repeated.</li>
    <li>A pie chart to differentiate the amount of jokes that include a question in it.</li>
</ul>
